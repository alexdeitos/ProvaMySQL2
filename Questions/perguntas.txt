Question #440 
A global company wants to allow anyone in the world to upload videos from a mobile phone. The company's mobile app
uploads the videos across the public internet to an Amazon S3 bucket in the us-east-1 Region for further processing.
Videos that users upload from locations that are distant from us-east-1 have slower upload speeds than videos that users
upload from close to us-east-1. In many cases, the slow uploads cause users from the distant locations to cancel their uploads.
Which solution will improve the upload speeds for the users from distant locations?
A. Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration on the S3 bucket. Change the mobile app to use the S3 Transfer Acceleration endpoint
for uploads.
B. Create an S3 access point for the S3 bucket in several AWS Regions across the world. Change the mobile app to use
the S3 access point endpoint for uploads.
D. Use S3 Select on the S3 bucket. Change the mobile app to use the S3 Select global endpoint for uploads.
D. Create new public Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in several AWS Regions across the world. Specify the S3 bucket as
the target of the NLBs. Change the mobile app to use the closest NLB for uploads.
Correct Answer: A


Question #441 
A company is using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to manage public SSL/TLS certificates. A SysOps administrator needs to
send an email notification when a certificate has less than 14 days until expiration.
Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Create an Amazon CloudWatch custom metric to monitor certificate expiration for all ACM certificates. Create an Amazon
EventBridge rule that has an event source of aws.cloudwatch. Configure the rule to send an event to a target Amazon
Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic if the DaysToExpiry metric is less than 14. Subscribe the appropriate email
addresses to the SNS topic.
B. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that has an event source of aws.acm. Configure the rule to evaluate the
DaysToExpiry metric for all ACM certificates. Configure the rule to send an event to a target Amazon Simple Notification
Service (Amazon SNS) topic if DaysToExpiry is less than 14. Subscribe the appropriate email addresses to the SNS topic.
C. Create an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard that displays the DaysToExpiry metric for all ACM certificates. If
DaysToExpiry is less than 14, send an email message to the appropriate email addresses. Send the email message by
running a predefined CLI command to publish to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.
D. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that has an event source of aws.acm. Configure the rule to evaluate the
DaysToExpiry metric for all ACM certificates. Configure a target SMS identity that uses a predefined email template.
Configure the rule to send an event to the target SMS identity if DaysToExpiry is less than 14.
Correct Answer: B


Question #442 
A SysOps administrator created an AWS CloudFormation template that provisions an Amazon EventBridge rule that invokes an
AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function is designed to write event details to an Amazon CloudWatch log group. The
function has permissions to write events to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. However, the SysOps administrator discovered that the
Lambda function is not running.
How should the SysOps administrator resolve the problem?
A. Update the CloudFormation stack to include an AWS::IAM::Role resource with the required IAM permissions for
EventBridge to invoke the function. Assign the role to the EventBridge rule.
B. Update the CloudFormation stack to include an AWS::IAM::Role resource with the required IAM permissions for the
function. Assign the role as the function execution role.
C. Update the CloudFormation stack with an AWS::Lambda::Permission resource to ensure events.amazonaws.com has
permissions to invoke the function.
D. Update the CloudFormation stack with an AWS::Lambda::Permission resource to ensure lambda.amazonaws.com has
permissions to invoke the function.
Correct Answer: C
